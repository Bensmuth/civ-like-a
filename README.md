This is a project I completed for my A-level computer science coursework at Sir John Deane's College using the amethyst game engine (which is no longer developed), if you're looking for an alternative to amethyst check out https://bevyengine.org/

## How to run
Some extra dependencies are required, but I haven't built this project in about a year. I believe I have a shell.nix lying around for it somewhere.
```bash
cargo run
```
